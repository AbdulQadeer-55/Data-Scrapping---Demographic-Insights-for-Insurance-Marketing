# **Enhanced Census Data Collection for Top Counties in the U.S.**

**Welcome to the Enhanced Census Data Collection Repository!** This project allows you to efficiently collect and analyze detailed population and socio-economic data for the top counties across the United States. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS), this repository automates the retrieval, processing, and saving of essential census data for a wide range of counties.

---

## **ðŸš€ Project Overview**

This project fetches detailed data from the **U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s API** for a set of counties in multiple states and compiles it into a clean, structured format. It gathers data points such as:

- **Total Population**
- **Population Aged 45+**
- **Median Household Income**
- **Educational Attainment**
- **Homeownership Rate**
- **Health Insurance Coverage**
- **Employment Rate**

The data is then saved into a neatly organized Excel file, where each county's details are captured in a separate sheet, making it easy to analyze the data.

---

## **ðŸ“ˆ Key Features**

- **Automated Data Collection**: Retrieves real-time U.S. Census data for counties across multiple states.
- **Detailed Demographic Insights**: Includes detailed population breakdowns by age, income, and educational attainment.
- **Smart Data Processing**: Handles errors gracefully and retries API requests using an exponential backoff strategy for better reliability.
- **Flexible Data Export**: Saves the results in an easy-to-use Excel file format, with all data neatly organized by state and county.
- **User-Friendly**: Minimal setup requiredâ€”simply insert your API key, and the script does the rest.

---

## **ðŸ”§ Requirements**

- Python 3.10.12
- `requests` for API calls
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `openpyxl` for exporting data to Excel

To install the necessary dependencies, simply run:

```bash
pip install requests pandas openpyxl
```

---

## **ðŸ”‘ Setup and Configuration**

1. **API Key**: To access the U.S. Census data, you need to provide your Census API key. You can get one from the U.S. Census website [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

2. **Insert the API Key**: Open the script and insert your API key in the following line:

   ```python
   API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Once youâ€™ve set your API key, run the script:

   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

   The script will automatically fetch data for the top counties, process it, and save it in an Excel file named `enhanced_state_top_25_counties_census.xlsx`.

## **ðŸ“Š Data Collected**

The following columns are included in the final dataset:

| Column Name                      | Description |

| **State**                         | The state in which the county is located. |
| **County**                        | The name of the county. |
| **Census Year**                   | The year the data was collected from the U.S. Census Bureau (default is 2020). |
| **Total Population**              | The total population of the county. |
| **Population Aged 45+**           | The total population of people aged 45 and older. |
| **Population Aged 45-64**         | The population of people aged 45 to 64. |
| **Population Aged 65+**           | The population of people aged 65 and older. |
| **Percent 45+ Population**        | The percentage of the population aged 45+ compared to the total population. |
| **Median Household Income**       | The median income of households in the county. |
| **Employment Rate (%)**           | The employment rate as a percentage of the total population. |
| **Bachelor's Degree or Higher (%)**| The percentage of people with a bachelor's degree or higher. |
| **Homeownership Rate (%)**        | The percentage of homes owned by their residents. |
| **Health Insurance Coverage (%)**| The percentage of people covered by health insurance. |
| **Average Household Size**        | The average number of people per household in the county. |
| **Population Density Score**      | A rough score based on the population density. |
| **Zip Codes**                     | The zip code range for the county. |
| **Sources Used**                  | The source of the data (U.S. Census ACS 5-Year Estimates). |
| **Data Accuracy**                 | Indicates if the data is accurate (default is "Yes"). |
| **Last Updated**                  | The date when the data was last updated. |
| **FIPS Code**                     | The Federal Information Processing Standards code for the state and county. |

## **ðŸ”„ Data Collection Flow**

1. **API Request**: The script constructs an API request for each county, fetching key demographic and socio-economic variables.
2. **Retry Mechanism**: If the request fails (due to rate limiting or temporary connectivity issues), the script automatically retries with an exponential backoff strategy to ensure reliable data collection.
3. **Data Processing**: Once the data is retrieved, the script processes it to convert raw values into useful metrics (e.g., calculating the percentage of people aged 45+).
4. **Excel Export**: The processed data is saved to an Excel file, with separate sheets for each state.

## **ðŸŽ¯ Why Use This Script?**

- **In-Depth Analysis**: By collecting and analyzing data for the top counties in the U.S., you can uncover powerful insights into demographic trends, income levels, educational attainment, and more.
- **Time-Saving**: No need to manually scrape data from different sourcesâ€”the script does all the hard work for you.
- **Flexible Output**: The Excel format ensures that the data can be easily shared, modified, and analyzed in tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or Power BI.
